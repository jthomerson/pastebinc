             Project home: https://github.com/jthomerson/pastebinc

pastebinc is really just a pet project because I want to get better at writing
c code (I come from a Java-intense background).  It "scratches an itch" so to 
speak.  I often want to paste a bit of a log file or script to pastebin and 
send it to a co-worker.  But, I have to get it on the console somehow (if it 
all fits), select it, copy and paste (which usually involves the mouse).  
Instead, I'd like to be able to do this:

$ cat somefile.sh | pastebinc
Your paste: http://pastebin.com/SomeURL

Or this:
$ tail -n some.log | pastebinc
Your paste: http://pastebin.com/SomeURL

I aim to make this tool be that simple to use and to support multiple pastebin
sites, including private ones, with simple configuration options.
